        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Chang Hao-Wei, I am 29 years old, and I graduated from the
          National Taiwan University Mechanical Engineering Institute, Heat Flow
          Division, specializing in heat transfer analysis and ground source
          heat pump applications. I am passionate about researching and applying
          heat transfer technology in various product designs. My interests
          include table tennis, fitness, and spinning.
        </p>
        <h3>Education and Beliefs</h3>
        <p>
          Since university, I have believed that in addition to professional
          ability, teamwork and interpersonal communication are also very
          important. Therefore, during my studies, I not only worked hard
          tolearn professional knowledge but also actively participated in club
          activities and served as a class leader to improve my skills in
          different areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>
          In the workplace, I served as a thermal engineer for ASUS graphics
          cards, responsible for several independent projects, covering many
          contemporary graphics card products. These experiences taught me how
          to communicate and coordinate with different departments (such as EE
          RD, Bios RD, ID, PM, etc.) and suppliers to ensure the smooth progress
          of projects. In the process, I gained valuable experiences and
          continuously improved my professional skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>
          In my future career, I expect to continue to break through and
          contribute to the company and department with my professional
          knowledge and experience. In my opinion, constantly pursuing progress,
          improving oneself, and applying learned knowledge in practical work is
          the best way to achieve professional success.
